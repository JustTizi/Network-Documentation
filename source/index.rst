SepsiLab Network documentation
==============================

This is the documentation for the project I made connecting multiple routers over a secure WireGuard tunnel to easily transmit MQTT sensor data.
This page will try to give a clear overview as well as being a guide for understanding the configuration among the different devices to allow easy editing of the settings as needed.
