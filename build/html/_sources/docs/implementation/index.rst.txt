Implementation
==============

In order to be able to have the MQTT data arrive inside the SepsiLab network, multiple settings had to be configured on the routers we have available. 

I'll be going over the following points:

* `GNS3`_
* `WireGuard`_
* `NAT`_
* `Firewall`_
* `Test results`_


.. include:: ./gns.rst

.. include:: ./wireguard.rst

.. include:: ./nat.rst

.. include:: ./firewall.rst

.. include:: ./testresults.rst


With this info, you should now be able to make your own hub-and-spoke network using MikroTik devices.

Thank you for reading, and have a great rest of your day! ☀️
