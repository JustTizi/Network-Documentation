Implementation
==============

In order to be able to have the MQTT data arrive inside the SepsiLab network, multiple settings had to be configured on the routers we have available. 

I'll be going over the following points:

* `WireGuard`_
* `NAT`_
* `Firewall`_


.. include:: ./wireguard.rst
    :name: wireguard

.. include:: ./nat.rst
    :name: nat

.. include:: ./firewall.rst
    :name: firewall
